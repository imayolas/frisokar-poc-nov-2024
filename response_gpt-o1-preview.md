**Executive Summary**

The Tribunal de Justiça do Estado de Goiás (TJGO) is issuing a public tender (Process PROAD: 202310000450203) to acquire office chairs to meet the demands of magistrates and public servants across various departments, including the Secretaria de Estado de Administração. This procurement aims to replace outdated furniture, address the lack of current stock, and enhance the ergonomic conditions for staff, thereby promoting health, productivity, and reducing long-term operational costs through durable and modern office furniture.

The tender specifies the acquisition of three types of chairs: high-back swivel chairs with headrests (Poltrona giratória, espaldar alto, tipo III), fixed interlocutor chairs (Poltrona fixa, interlocutoria), and operational swivel chairs (Poltrona giratória, operacional, tipo I). The total quantities required are 544 units for the high-back swivel chairs, 2,153 units for the fixed interlocutor chairs, and 2,197 units for the operational swivel chairs. The procurement will be conducted under the Sistema de Registro de Preços (SRP) with a contract validity of 12 months and follows the regulations stipulated in Brazilian Federal Law No. 8.666/1993.

This tender emphasizes the importance of ergonomics, sustainability, and compliance with technical specifications and certifications. Suppliers are required to provide chairs that meet detailed technical requirements, including material quality, adjustability features, and adherence to specific standards (e.g., ABNT NBR certifications). The chairs are intended to improve working conditions, prevent health issues related to prolonged work hours, and demonstrate the TJGO's commitment to providing a conducive work environment for its employees.
